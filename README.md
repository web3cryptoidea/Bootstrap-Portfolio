# third-challenge

This repository contains third challenge for Web Development Bootcamp.

## Description

As a web developer I want to create a portfolio that showcases my skills and projects. I dedicated this portfolio to Web 3 articles and blogs. So far I added 6 articles from my Medium blog to my portfolio. 

I want this page to contain basic information about me as Natcracker and my projects. At the same time I don't want to give more details about myself as it's Web3 style and keep my anonymity and privacy.
